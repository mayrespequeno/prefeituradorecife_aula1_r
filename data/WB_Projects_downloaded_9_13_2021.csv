These peri-urban areas of cities, for exa mple Dehradun, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Roorkee, Haldwani, have very low coverage of about 30% to 40% household connections for water su pply.

The mechanism’s design will build on lessons learned and on problem-driven applied political economy analysis. Health committees (COSAN)10and health users will be mobili zed to assess service performance, jointly with key stakeholders, including Municipal Health Development Committees (CCSDs11) and Ma nagement Committees (COGE) of health centers (CSB). - Strengthening the linkage between municipal and health sector planning throu gh the adoption of concerted action plans (linked to dotation CSB reform) and a participatory budgeting process at the municipal lev el, based on universal health coverage policy standards (quality, spatial coverage, increased access to care, diseases prevention). The project will help local actors identify and target specific issues municipality by municipality through collaborative social acc ountability mechanisms, with an emphasis on inclusive participation of the local population and vulnerable groups, and on reinforcin g the link between municipal consultation organs such as SLC (Local Consultation Structures)12 and CCDS. Building on identified ga ps from past and ongoing experiences, and on a political economic analysis that will be conducted during the project’s inception pha se, revisions to the proposed mechanism will zero in on critical gaps, including (i) the ability of community agents (CAs) to comply  with their mandate, (ii) community agents’ interface with health centers and relevant municipal decision-making instances, and (iii ) links between municipal decision-making and district/regional health sector plans and resource allocation.
